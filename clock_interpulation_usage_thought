probe+Interpolation Hybrid:
After each LLC sweep (occupancy probing), stall and count cycles until next performance.now() clock edge.
Record both the sweep time and the post-sweep interpolation counter.
Use the interpolation to reduce timing jitter or as an additional ML feature for richer classification.

**** NOTE ****
    without SAB!!! so wont need to require isolation
